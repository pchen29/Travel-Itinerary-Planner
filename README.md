### README for TripAdivisor_Scraper
#### All scrapers can only be used for training data 

I have spent a lot of time to figure out the anti-scraper problem, but sometimes I still blocked by the tripadivisor sometimes. 

The Scrapers temporarily can be opened via Jupyter Notebook. If necessary, I will change to .py later
